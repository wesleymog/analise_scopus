Definição e Propósito,4,1,"Counteracting Agile Retrospective Problems with Retrospective Activities, Game-based Sprint retrospectives: multiple action research, Learning in the large - an exploratory study of retrospectives in large-scale agile development, Towards Empirically Validated Remedies for Scrum Retrospective Headaches","One of the core principles of all agile methods is the need for continuous process improvement: ""At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly"" (Highsmith and Fowler 2001). An agile practice that provides time and space for the team to come together in order to inspect, fix, and improve their process is a retrospective meeting | Accordingly, the retrospective is an opportunity for the team to look back over an iteration and recognize successes and failures; to link the related experience to people, the development process, engineering practices, and tools; and to create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next iteration (Dybå et al. 2014b; Lehtinen et al. 2015, Lehtinen et al. 2017; Dingsøyr et al. 2018; Ilyés 2019).  | Indeed, the retrospective is one of the most frequently mentioned agile practices in the context of software process improvement (Mas et al. 2018; Küpper et al. 2019). | Schwaber et al. define a retrospective as an ""opportunity for the team to inspect itself"". During these meetings the project team discusses a finished project or iteration, focusing on successes as well as encountered challenges and defines steps to improve their process in the future. | Retrospectives provide time and space to discuss and improve a team's development process, leading to increased performance and enjoyment during the following iteration | these meetings allow implementing the principles """"motivate all people involved"""" and """"create a learning organization"""" of the Software Process Improvement (SPI) manifesto | Many see retrospectives as the most important practice of agile software development. | The Agile Practice Guide describes them as ""the single most important practice in agile development""  and in his much read book on Scrum and XP, Kniberg states that retrospectives are the ""number-one-most-important thing in Scrum | The purpose of retrospectives is to explore the work results of a team in an iteration or a phase in order to ""learn about, improve, and adapt its process"" | any previous studies have seen retrospectives as an arena for reflection to enable learning and process improvement | ""The Scrum Guide defines the purpose of Retros as inspecting 'how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools'. Thus, Retros not only represent opportunities for teams to improve their ways of collaboration and teamwork, but also empowerment and enjoyment in future development iterations | the Retro deals with how it was built and how the next Sprint can be improved, i.e. the process and the human factors involved. | Retros have their own set of requirements for participants and face their own set of challenges. In particular, the literature concerning Agile practitioners has highlighted problems which repeatedly appear in these meetings",13

Desafios de Eficácia,4,2,"Counteracting Agile Retrospective Problems with Retrospective Activities, Game-based Sprint retrospectives: multiple action research, Reflection in Agile Retrospectives, Scaling scrum in a large globally distributed organization: A case study","Therefore, our interviewees felt that no real improvements followed from the common retrospectives. Huge problems remained, and common retrospectives were considered useless.  | People actually maybe don't see what's the value of being there, because we discuss, then we decide something, and if you don't see the results, then maybe you are not so inclined to come again. [...] then we say this needs to change, but in the end nothing happens. [...] One thing that will bring more people is that they see that actually there are decisions made there and this affects their work. [...] whoever is there, gets the right to decide, so if they see that actually this affects their daily work. 
— Team member | You could make 200 action points of your 20 weeks, but not a single one of those was followed up on, you really haven't done anything. | Based on the observation of their retrospective meeting, it was seen that they did not discuss their feelings explicitly and only discussed briefly the obstacles related to changing of task priorities needing confirmation with the product manager. They did not discuss it further as once they agreed on that obstacle then the product manager directly proceeded to the Scrum Board, discussed the issue and wrapped up the meeting. They did not record any outcomes, such as a plan or action points, from the meeting. There was little evidence of analyzing previous action points, identifying background reasons and identifying future action points. | he received feedback indicates that the approach helped the teams to mitigate many of the ""accidental difficulties"" pertaining to the Sprint Retrospective, such as lack of structure, dullness, too many complaints, or unequal participation and made the meetings more productive to some degree. | the same ideas come up every time; | there is not enough to talk about based on a single Sprint; | wasting time on long, ineffectual debates on one issue while neglecting other issues due to a lack of time; | it is hard to prioritize issues and focus on the most important ones, because team members want to discuss and explore potential solutions for all of the problems in one meet-ing. | Kua and Rubin collected agile retrospective smells, such as All Talk, No Action or the Blame Game | – All Talk–No Action - failing to decide on action items defining the next
steps and therefore having no clear path for improvement. | During the retrospectives we observed the problems: No Preparation, Not Speaking Up, All Talk–No Action, and Too Repetitive.",13
Desafios de Foco,2,2,"Game-based Sprint retrospectives: multiple action research, Reflection in Agile Retrospectives",Understanding this is particularly important as agile teams are reported to focus more on their technical progress and tend to pay less attention to how reflection is performed thereby compromising their potential for improvement | there is no good discussion on how to improve the teamwork;,2

As reported by several studies, the Sprint Retrospective is an agile practice most likely to be implemented improperly or sacrificed when teams perform under pressure to deliver. | retrospectives are too short to come up with solutions to complex problems, so additional meetings should be planned; | Lamoreux (2005) reported that in their organization, the retrospective was one of the most challenging agile practices to implement and they encountered many roadblocks to effective reflection.  | As a side effect of our project, we found out that the main causes of reducing the frequency of retrospective meetings were not the retrospective itself, but organizational dysfunctions. Issues such as difficulties in communication between developers and the Product Owner or between different teams, forcing teams to overload the Sprint Backlog, and assigning people to multiple Scrum teams were raised during retrospectives before our project started, but nothing was done since the solution would either violate the corporate governance or required corrective actions at the organizational level. This impossibility caused frustration, which in turn caused teams to skip retrospective meetings | – No Preparation – not thoroughly preparing a meeting, leaving participants
feeling lost and their time not being valued. | The problem which was most often addressed by the use of activities was No Preparation. | In a study of retrospective practices at team level, Lethinen et al. found that most discussions were related to topics close to and controllable by the team, but that topics that could not be resolved at the team level due to their complexity nevertheless recurred over time.",11
Desafios de Participação,4,"1, 2","Counteracting Agile Retrospective Problems with Retrospective Activities, Game-based Sprint retrospectives: multiple action research, Reflection in Agile Retrospectives, Scaling scrum in a large globally distributed organization: A case study","Since participation was voluntary, the team members voted with their feet, and finally the meeting had only very few participants. | People actually maybe don't see what's the value of being there, because we discuss, then we decide something, and if you don't see the results, then maybe you are not so inclined to come again.

— Team member | The more time pressure experienced in the project, the less people participated in the common retros. However, some of the interviewees commented that those persons who actively wanted to change things came, which was seen as positive. | All the time the number of participants went down. You could notice that the more time pressure we had [in the project], the less people came. [...] So, now no more than ten people show up in the common retros. [...] But I have been going there, as there's always something.... [...] There has started to be people that are really exited about changing things. So it's kind of motivating that here are people who are still interested in things. 
— Team member | Another interesting observation was that they had adapted the retrospective practice, which seemed too repetitive for them and people often seemed to have forgotten about what happened during the last two weeks' sprint. As result, they were used to placing all the individual reviews written up on sticky notes in a ""retro box"" – a box especially allocated to collect individual reflec‐ tion. If there were no sticky notes during a two weeks' sprint, they would not perform a retrospective meeting. | he received feedback indicates that the approach helped the teams to mitigate many of the ""accidental difficulties"" pertaining to the Sprint Retrospective, such as lack of structure, dullness, too many complaints, or unequal participation and made the meetings more productive to some degree. | a few vocal participants dominate the discussion, while others only listen even though they have profound views on things; | participants use the meeting primarily to complain rather than to improve. | Their initial reluctance to have regular retrospectives was overcome after they adopted the Conversation Café technique, which can be considered to be a retrospective game. | difficulties in writing down ideas expressed in long unstructured oral statements; | – Too Repetitive – repetitive retrospectives lead to fatigue and boredom, thus
negatively aﬀecting outcomes and team motivation. | – Blame Game – when a team is pointing fingers and assigning blame to team
members instead of constructively searching for solutions. | – Not Speaking Up – team members are reluctant to openly address their
feelings and perceptions or known problem in the group. | – Taking It Personally – team members feel hurt by the statements of others,
leading to a charged and adversarial atmosphere. | – Group Think – the team values harmony and consensus higher than a
critical discussion, which leads to fewer improvement possibilities. | – Focus on Negatives – a team losing its perception of positives from the
past sprint due to a focus on negatives leading to negative team spirit. | – Complain Game – Participants viewing the meeting as a chance to complain
and unload regarding the past instead of a chance to improve.",20

Several discussions took place simultaneously. Our interviewees commented that that was fun, a lot of discussions around flaps, but again the same problem remained: the discussions did not lead to any real changes. | The retrospectives similarly followed a combination of online and offline practices. The co-located office team worked with post-it notes in a meeting room and discussed the outcomes of a release while the remote worker participated via a video or audio call, or through an online support tool such as Appear.in. | The Scrum framework calls this the Sprint Retrospective (Schwaber and Sutherland 2020). However, team reflexivity as a group level construct is older than the Agile Manifesto (for review, see (Collier et al. 1996; Dingsøyr and Hanssen 2003)).

Fatores Contextuais,3,"1, 2","Agile ways of working - A team maturity perspective, Counteracting Agile Retrospective Problems with Retrospective Activities, Learning in the large - an exploratory study of retrospectives in large-scale agile development","Retrospectives originally appeared in the form of postmortem meetings at the end of a project to learn from success or failures | We were able to identify multiple of the collected retrospective problems in ret-rospectives of teams from both professional and educational backgrounds. | Our analysis of topics addressed in the retrospectives shows that most of the issues identified as either «working well» or «could be improved» related to process, followed by people and relationships. | We find, however, that teams mainly deal with team-internal issues in retrospectives | Prior studies in organizational psychology suggest that in projects with many teams, the coordination between teams are more important than coordination within teams. It is reason to believe it would be beneficial to focus attention on inter-team issues in large projects. | As can be seen in Table 3, more mature teams make the intended use of the following practices (P < .01): (2) iterative development (.647*) which is a strong correlation (or a large effect), and (6) retrospectives (.490**), which is a medium correlation/effect but very close to a large effect of .5. | The significant correlations found between iterative development and retrospectives and GDQ Scale IV give us insight into what agile practices are connected to the group maturity level in order to function in the intended way. | However, we could not observe every problem from our collection of relevant problems during the retrospectives we attended",8

What are we doing well? 2. What do we need to revise/rethink? 3. What should we be doing that we are not doing? 4. What are the blockers? | Each attendee was able to write their thoughts anonymously directly into the table using a shared wiki, and although the questions were considered one after the other, it was possible for participants to go back and modify their own earlier entries. After everyone had finished writing their entries, the group discussed each entry in turn. The session was audio recorded and the entries made against each of the questions were distributed afterwards and agreed. | There is a standard format commonly used to conduct an agile retrospective meeting
which involves setting the stage, gathering data, generating insight, deciding what to
do and closing the retrospective meeting | Table 1 | Generating a Plan. In reconstructing, teams generated plans decided from their discussion in the retrospective meeting. Action points are an explicit outcome of the retrospective meeting. It is useful to remind all team members about the goal for the next sprint, who will responsible, and what are the associated deadlines. | We found that there are six important aspects discussed in the retrospective meetings: identifying and discussing obstacles, discussing feelings, analyzing previous action points, identifying background reasons, identifying future action points and generating a plan. | During the meeting, three key questions should be answered (Schwaber 2004; Ringstad et al. 2011):
- What went well, that if we don't discuss, we might forget?
- What did not work and how can we improve it?
- What will we commit to improve in the next iteration? | The output of a retrospective are ""action items"" (Derby and Larsen 2006), which define identified issues as well as possible corrective actions to resolve them (Matthies 2020). All action items should be assigned to volunteers who will take appropriate steps to implement them. Anything that exceeds the authority or scope of responsibility of the team should be escalated to management and considered in an organization-level retrospective (Carlson 2013; Lehtinen et al. 2017; Guckenbiehl and Theobald 2020). | The output of retro-spective meetings is a list of action items, including the next steps necessary to proceed and address the identified issues | First, we took notice of the fact that several of the collected methods prescribe an inherent structure by making use of a form of brainstorming followed by a sharing of ideas and thoughts and ending with a discussion, e.g. Open the Box. | Sailboat [11,18,20,25]. The Sailboat is a popular retrospective activity. The
main idea is to think about the past sprint with a sailboat metaphor, see Fig.1.
Four elements influence the boat: Wind (positives), anchors (negatives), sun
(opportunities) and icebergs (dangers).  | Overall our observations and the answers to our questionnaire supported most of the problem – activity pairs we tested and the participants generally liked the activities they had used. | Similarly, we found evidence that activities which provide silent thinking time and ask for personal feelings, e.g. Sailboat or Peaks and Valleys Timeline support team members in sharing their perceptions and thus address the problem Not Speaking Up | The results of the case studies indicate a positive effect of six retrospective activities on four retrospective problems. | This is in line with Derby's def-inition of the goals of retrospective activities, i.e. to ""provide structure to help the team think together | We believe this can help to increase the effectiveness of retrospectives and to improve teamwork, work satisfaction, quality of work and productivity of the teams employing such a mapping in their retrospectives | Kniberg describes a retrospective practice as a team exercise lasting 1–3 h where a team identifies what has been «good», what «could have been better» and «improvements», and suggest voting on the improvements to focus on in the next iteration. | The practices described in the research literature typically involve additional steps, for example including root cause analysis in order to analyse topics identified before deciding on action items to include in the next iteration | The study found that ""important aspects discussed in retrospective meetings include identifying and discussing obstacles, discussing feelings, analysing previous action points, identifying back-ground reasons, identifying future action points and generating a plan"" | Outcomes of these meetings are a list of 'identified improvements' or 'action items' that will be enacted in the following Sprint."" | Derby and Larsen introduced a general agenda for Retros, featuring five consecutive phases—set the stage, gather data, generate insights, decide what to do, close—and proposed activities for each stage. This concept was adopted by other authors | To alleviate Retro headaches, multiple types of remedies have been proposed by both researchers and practitioners. These remedies often take the form of games or timeboxed group activities that suggest specific meeting actions for Retros and can help teams ""think together"" and to ""break the usual routine"". They help alleviate common Retro headaches by encouraging the exploration of new perspectives, increasing motivation and supporting team-building efforts",27
